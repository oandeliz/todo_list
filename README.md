# todo_list

Hello, I'm Oscar Andeliz a developer in training.

I decided to build this app call todo_list. 
I wanted to learn more about data structure and how to work with SQL.

My goal with this app is to be able to handle data better.
and to make sure that I have an app that has a CRUD database.

I will be using this YouTube tutorial to start (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFctmsTDoa0&list=LL&index=17).
Then I will use other resources, because I would like to have buttons to update and delete data from the db.

This project would be done in flutter.
