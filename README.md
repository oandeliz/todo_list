# todo_list

Hello, I'm Oscar Andeliz a developer in training.

I decided to build this app call todo_list. Which is a basically an app that will have a list pof imputs by the user. The list will contain tasks that the user would like to do, and should remind the user of those tasks.
It will also have a checkbox to remind the user when they finish a task.


My goal with this app is to be able to handle data better. It should teach how to build SQFLite tables and to have a primary key and to have foreing keys as well. 
Also to learn CRUD, which stand for create, read, update, delete. Migration will be added to better handle the versions of the database. 

I will be using this YouTube tutorial to start (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFctmsTDoa0&list=LL&index=17).
For the migration i will be using this article (https://medium.com/flutter-community/migrating-a-mobile-database-in-flutter-sqlite-44ac618e4897)

Other technologies are asdf which will helped me with downloading a reliable flutter version.
This project will be done in flutter using the IDE called IntelliJ IDEA. Which will allow me to run the project on an android device.
